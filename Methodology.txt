Data Collection: Downloaded Landsat scenes (cloud-free) from 2015 to 2025.

Preprocessing:

Clipping using shapefile

Masking clouds (optional)

Extracting NIR and Red bands

NDVI Calculation: Pixel-wise using the NDVI formula

Time Series Generation: Monthly/seasonal NDVI mean values

Stationarity Check: ADF Test, differencing

Modeling: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

Forecasting: Predicting NDVI trends into the near future
